the currency exchange rate is one of the most important determinants of a country's relative level of economic health. 
Exchange rates play a vital role in a country's level of trade, which is critical to most every free market economy in the world.

Currency exchange rates can impact merchandise trade, economic growth, capital flows, inflation and interest rates. 
Examples of large currency moves impacting financial markets include the Asian Financial Crisis and the unwinding of the Japanese yen carry trade.
